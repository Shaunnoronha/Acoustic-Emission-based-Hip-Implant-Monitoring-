        <b>Machine Learning Techniques For Acoustic Emission Monitoring Of Hip Implants</b><br>
        The outcome of this project involves the application of machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret
        the acoustic emission data generated by hip implants during daily activities. Our aim is to develop a deep
        learning model that learns the acoustic emission patterns and classifies the current health of the implant.
        This approach enables the identification of subtle changes and anomalies that may indicate early signs of
        implant deterioration, providing a proactive and predictive monitoring solution. The proposed solution
        enhances the current state of hip implant monitoring by offering a more nuanced and accurate assessment of
        implant performance.
    </p>
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>
        The project is applicable in the healthcare industry, specifically in the field of orthopedics and hip
        transplant monitoring.
